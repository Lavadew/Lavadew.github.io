My Portfolio

This portfolio is a mean to test my coding skills as well as looking for ways to improve myself. Over the time I will be updating this website either
by redoing the portfolio all together or making small changes to improve the user experiences. 

To my fellow peeps, please give me any feedback on ways I can do better to improve my portfolio website.
